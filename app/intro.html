<p>Thyroid disease is the commonest endocrine condition in women of childbearing age and complicates approximately 1-2% of pregnancies. The hyper-metabolic state of normal pregnancy makes clinical assessment of thyroid function more difficult and therefore thyroid function often needs to be checked biochemically. However physiological changes of pregnancy, including 50% plasma volume expansion, increased thyroid binding globulin production and a relative iodine defficiency, mean that thyroid hormone reference ranges for non-pregnant women may not be appropriate in pregnancy.</p>

<p>One acceptable approach for establishing legitimate reference ranges requires that a Box-Cox transformation be applied to the data, and prediction ranges calculated using using classical polynomial regression. Alternatively, non-parametric smoothing such as quantile can be used to estimate the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles. Although this approach provides an estimate of the reference range, it does not routinely quantify the precision of the end points of this reference range. This is the aim of the project.</p>
